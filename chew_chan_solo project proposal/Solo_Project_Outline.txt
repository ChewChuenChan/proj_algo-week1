 Project Description: 
 	My solo project is about a website that can order the meal prep order for family. It has 3 big selections: Classic, Lean & Clean and Vegetarian. 
	In each selection plan, these are meals accordingly into the plan. 
	People can browser them before they can sign up to buy them. 
	Once they selected their meal plan, they need to provide the delivery address and date. 
	They can view the order they made, edit or delete it. 

New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: 
	I want to learn many to many relationship cause this project will need to use many to many. 

Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2)
	I hope to get some advices about my project before I can present it.

Week 2 Features (to show at the first office hour/lecture of Week 3)
